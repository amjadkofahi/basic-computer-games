Original source downloaded from [Vintage Basic](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html).

Conversion to [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org).  Note that while the original game separated the instructions into a separate BASIC program (probably due to memory limitations), we have chosen here to combine them into one MiniScript program with both instructions and gameplay.  The instructions are available at the start of the game, and later at any time via the HLP command.

Ways to play:

1. Command-Line MiniScript:
Download for your system from https://miniscript.org/cmdline/, install, and then run the program with a command such as:
```
	miniscript superstartrek.ms
```

2. Mini Micro:
Download Mini Micro from https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/, launch, and then click the top disk slot and chose "Mount Folder..."  Select the folder containing the MiniScript program and this README file.  Then, at the Mini Micro command prompt, enter:
```
	load "superstartrek"
	run
```
